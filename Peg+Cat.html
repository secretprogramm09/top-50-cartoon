    <p>The Fred Rogers Company introduces a new animated preschool series featuring Peg and her sidekick, Cat, as they encounter unexpected challenges that require arithmetic and problem-solving skills. Each episode features two stories in which Peg and Cat face a math word problem that they must solve. Children will learn how to build calculation skills and think about larger concepts that will help them form the foundation for learning math at any level, from kindergarten through calculus.
