    <p>The Angry Beavers

        Brothers Daggett and Norbert Beaver have left home to gain independence by living on their own in the forest near their Oregon hometown. Their goal is to live a wild bachelor lifestyle but, as might be expected from young brothers, they get into some weird situations. The brothers run into everything from wacky government scientists to a swamp witch and evil, mind-controlling pond scum. One of the brothers' good friends is Stump, a giant tree stump, who is an integral part of their inner circle.
