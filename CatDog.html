        Conjoined siblings -- one a dog, the other a cat -- deal with the unique challenges of their existence. Cat, the more clever of the two, frequently has a plan or a scheme in the works, and more often than not, that scheme goes awry. Together, the brothers face constant ridicule from the Greaser Dogs, as well as from Winslow, a mouse that lives in the wall of their house. Cat longs for fame and fortune, while Dog is happy chasing garbage trucks -- a pursuit that always ends with Cat being towed helplessly along as Dog runs headlong after the next truck.
