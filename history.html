    <p>Émile Cohl (1857 – 1938) was a French caricaturist of the largely forgotten </p> Movement, cartoonist, director and animator, known as the “Father of the Animated Cartoon".
</p>Cohl’s short film Fantasmagorie (1908) is considered the first fully animated cartoon film.</p> It is made up of 700 drawings, each of which was double-exposed, giving a running time of almost two minutes.</p>Despite the short running time, the piece was packed with material devised in a "stream of consciousness" style.</p>
